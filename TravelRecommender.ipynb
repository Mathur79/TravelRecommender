Atal Tunnel now allows travellers to reach Sissu within a few hours making Spiti way more accessible. It snows the most in the months of January & February followed by December and March. If you\\'re very lucky, you might find some snow in April. Tourists flock to Rohtang Pass & Solang valley for various adventure activities including skiing, paragliding, horse-riding & zorbing. Rohtang Pass is almost always covered with snow and can often get overcrowded and see traffic jams.\"]  ;;  CountofPlaces : 50  ;;  CostofStay : Hotel : 500 -5000   GuestHouse : 2000 -8000   Homestay : 1000 - 4000   Luxury Camps : 800 - 3000   Boutique Hotel : 500 - 6000     ;;  '"
